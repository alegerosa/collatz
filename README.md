# The Collazt Conjecture on Python
Simple script that runs a number through the Collatz Conjecture and prints the steps

When you input a number, the program applies the Collatz Conjecture rules:
* If the number is even, divide it by two;
* if it's odd multiply by three and add one;
* repeat until you reach one.

The program prints all steps and finally prints how many steps it took to get to 1.

Originally written in 2016, it was inspired by this [Someecards post](https://www.someecards.com/life/school/collatz-conjecture/).

This was my first program and my first Python script that wasn't directly following instructions from the Internet, so it's only fitting that it also becomes my first GitHub repository :heart:
